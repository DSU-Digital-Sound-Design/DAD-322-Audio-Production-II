<!-- TODO: three major projects based on each part of the mix book -->

# Project 1 - preliminary mix tasks

Create a mix of [Broken Man by Speak Softly](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk-newbies/#SpeakSoftly). Use the techniques we've learned so far in the class.

The project should have the following:

- Organization
  - The correct tempo so that the transport timeline is in sync with the waveforms
  - instruments organized by type and colored, group instruments accordingly
  - markers at the start of new song sections, verse, chorus, bridge etc.
- Cleaning up audio
  - silences removed so you can clearly see the arrangement
  - Rhythmic quantization if necessary. You may not need to use stretch markers. See what you can do by just aligning off rhythm elements to the grid. Look at the synth bass and see what you can fix there.
  - Perform pitch correction with ReaTune on the lead and background vocals.
    - Figure out the key of the song. With auto correction work or do you need to do manual correction?
  - Align the background vocals to the grid and each other.

# Project 2 - balance and dynamics processing

Mix of a project from the small [scale projects for building confidence section](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk-newbies/#SmallScale). **Use only stock Reaper plugins**.

This mix should include:

1. Everything from project 1
2. High-pass filter every track to remove unwanted low frequencies
3. Use item gain to adjust the volume of each track so that there is no clipping. Do this before you begin your balancing tasks.
4. After setting the item gain, set an initial mix balance with the faders.
5. Pan tracks when necessary, remembering to use the stereo pan mode when panning stereo tracks to adjust the panning and wideness.
6. Use compression to tame any tracks that are difficult to find stable fader positions for. By reducing their dynamic range, it should be easier to find a place for them in the mix.
7. Use gating to remove unwanted elements from the mix, especially spill (ex. the snare mic recorded a lot of high hat).
8. Use transient design to add back in transients that were dulled by compression or sustain to tracks that need it.

A requirement that the mix is listened to in the studio on the mains, the behritone and headphones.

Write about what differences you heard between the different speakers and how you accounted for them.

Turn in your consolidated project file to D2L.
