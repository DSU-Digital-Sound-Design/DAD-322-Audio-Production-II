- [From subjection impressions to objective results](../posts/week-2/friday/)
  - How to use a reference mix
  - Setup a folder with all your tracks
  - Add your reference mix outside of the folder, make sure this track isn't routed through your master if you have any master fx.

Homework: Make a list of two mix references for three styles of music. Turn in the list on d2l. Make sure you listen on different speakers and in different rooms and at different volumes. Write a paragraph about each song explaining why you picked it.

# Week 4

## Monday 1/31

### Balance

- Show [Broken Man mix](https://mtkdata.cambridgemusictechnology.co.uk/MTK006/SpeakSoftly_BrokenMan_Full.zip), start working on this it's due on Friday
- Tuning adjustments
  - ReaTune - manual and automatic adjustments
- Vocal alignment
  actions
  - Lock to active take
- Recording - One source (Percussion), one mic (ADK S7)
  - Use [Groove Pizza](https://apps.musedlab.org/groovepizza) as ideas for recording percussion tracks
  - We'll record takes so we can comp them together later
  - Quantize them to the beat

## Wednesday 2/2

- [Building raw balance](../posts/week-4/balance/)
- Takes and comping
  - create splits between phrases
  - choose which phrase you like better between the takes
  - crop to active take
  - or make a comp and name it to save the other takes
  - then we have some comp options
  - Then check out comp takes
- Try again with drum recording

## Friday 2/4

- [Project 1](../projects/#project-1) due by midnight
- More mixing of Broken Man
  - Check balance again, lets try to keep the tracks from peaking
  - then lets start mixing with the faders, setting them all to -inf dB then bringing them up in order of their importance.
  - adjusting the faders will actually not keep us from doing volume automation later on. This is an issue with Ableton Live, but not Reaper.
  - add [panning](../posts/week-4/panning)
  - let's not forget to listen to our panning changes in mono with the Behritone! do we loose any sounds? If we do let's narrow their image, especially if those are important elements.
  - This mix has no instruments that are multi-miked, this provides its own set of issues which we'll cover in other mixes.
