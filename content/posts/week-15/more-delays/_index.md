title: "More on delays"
---

In this lesson, we'll look at our project from the reverb lesson and try to replace the reverb effects with delays. But, first, let's listen to [Mike Senior's](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/ch17/) examples of using delay for blend, size, and overall effects.

Many third-party delay plugins have unique features, so we'll spend some time installing some of them and exploring their parameters and presets.

Download the following plugins and install them. I have only listed cross-platform plugins here. Reference the website if you're looking for plugins that only run on Windows.

Mixing delays:

- [Tempo Delay - Voxengo](https://www.voxengo.com/product/tempodelay/)
- [Full Bucket Brigade Delay](https://www.fullbucket.de/music/fbdelay.html)
- [GVST GDuckDly](https://www.gvst.co.uk/gduckdly.htm)

Creative delay effects:

- [Ursa DSP - Lagrange](https://ursadsp.com/)
- [Valhalla Freq Echo](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/delay/valhalla-freq-echo/)
- [Valhalla Supermassive](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-supermassive/)
- [Chow Matrix](https://chowdsp.com/products.html)
- [Glitch Machines - Hysteresis](https://glitchmachines.com/products/hysteresis/)
- [Soundhack - Delay Bundle](https://www.soundhack.com/freeware/)
- [Rift Feedback delay](https://www.minimal.audio/products/rift-feedback-lite) - very interesting for comb filtering and tuned feedback

## Tone Delay

Let's use a delay to get a more exciting tone on the acoustic guitar track. First, set up a delay send track. Use the `Full Bucket Brigade Delay` plugin and dial in a simple delay setting with no modulation. Experiment with very short delay time settings to get a comb-filtering effect. Next, add some feedback to intensify the tonal effect of the delay on the guitar track. Also, experiment with adding a bandpass filter on the delay send to filter out some of the harsh effects of the added feedback.

> Now try the same effect with the next guitar track.

## Sustain Delay

Let's use the electric guitar track and add some sustain to it. Pick a delay plugin that allows for tempo-synced delays. I'm using `Valhalla Freq Echo.` Set the project tempo correctly, then the delay time to sound musical with the guitar strumming rhythm. Try either 1/8 or 1/16 note delay times. Add a little bit of feedback. Then use the built-in EQ to focus the repeats only on the higher spectrum. Experiment with applying some frequency shifting.

## Blend Delay

Now experiment with using a delay to blend the drums folder. Create a delay send and send each drum to it. Create a slapback delay effect. A slapback delay has a short delay time but is not fast enough to produce comb filtering, usually 30-80 ms. Again EQ the return to get rid of unwanted low and high-frequency content.

> Let's spend the rest of class exploring some more creative reverbs. With the time left, create a piece of music using whatever sonic material you want with one or more of the creative delay effects. We'll listen to everyone's when there are about 10 minutes left.
