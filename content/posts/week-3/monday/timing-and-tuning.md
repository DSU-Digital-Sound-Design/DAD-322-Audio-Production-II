title: "Timing and tuning"
---

If your track was recorded to a click editing will be much easier. If it wasn't you'll need to adjust the tempo of your DAW to match the recording so that you can do timing editing later.

Make a tempo map to align things to your drums without having it be a strict grid. Click view and tempo map to see the tempo. Use an instrument that plays on the 1 of a measure to make a tempo map. Now you can use the tempo map to align your tracks to the drums.

After you make the tempo map you can now edit the drums and other parts to match the real tempo of the song. Group your drum tracks together so you can edit them at the same time. Make sure when you select one item it doesn't select every other item in the group. Next, make sure these options are selected in the options menu:

- Auto-crossfade media items when editing
- Trim content behind media items when editing

Now pick a drum sound that you feel has the most importance. The edits will be in relation to this part. It should probably be the kick or snare. Split it by its transients using "Dynamic split items". If you "split selected and grouped items" then all of your drums will be split based on the snare, or whichever drum you picked. Now do the same process to the other drum, i'll do the kick now. Now quantize your drum group to the grid. Go through and check that your crossfades aren't covering up the transients of your kick or snare. Move to each crossfade with "command + ]". If you find a crossfade that's out of place you can move it with the shift key.
